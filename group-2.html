            <p>Our ocean unifies our world like nothing else. And saving it from ongoing threats is a cause that affects us all. We are on the front lines of ocean protection, investing in research, leadership and advocacy that advances science-based solutions that work.</p><br>
            <p>Give today and make a difference for the future of our ocean!</p>

            <h4>2. Vote on ocean issues</h4>
                <p>Electing public officials that support good ocean policies can help us protect marine life and our oceans. Do your research on candidates and make an informed decision, then exercise your right (and responsibility) to vote. And don’t let Election Day be the last time they hear from you. Follow up with your candidates and elected officials regularly to remind them of policies you care about.</p>

            <h4>3. Pledge to quit the cutlery</h4>
            <p>You already Skip the Straw, bring your own grocery bags and carry a reusable water bottle wherever you go. If you’re looking for one more easy way to help the ocean, consider this: quit the cutlery.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2018, for the first time since Ocean Conservancy first began counting cutlery as a separate data category, plastic forks, knives and spoons were among the top ten most-collected items in the world during Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup (ICC). ICC volunteers removed nearly 2 million from beaches and waterways around the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A 2015 study by Ocean Conservancy scientists and partners found that plastic cutlery are among the most dangerous to ocean animals such as seabirds and turtles, especially as they break up into smaller microplastics.</p>

            <p>For the sake of our ocean and the animals that call it home…</p>

            <p><b>Pledge to Quit the Cutlery</b></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Stash a spork. Throw a travel set of reusable cutlery into your bag or purse so you’re always ready for an ocean-friendly snack.</li>

            <li>When eating out, dine in. Choose places that offer reusable silverware. You’d be surprised how many fast-casual places have reusable utensils—it never hurts to ask!</li>

            <li>When on the go, just say no. If ordering food to-go or picking up food, say “no thanks” to plastic forks, knives and spoons.</li>
            <li>Get messy. If reusable cutlery isn't an option, consider ordering finger foods like pizza or sandwiches.</li></ul>
