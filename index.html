	<div><h2>Our Mission</h2><p>A resilient ocean sustains marine life and functioning ecosystems that support rich biodiversity, food security and sustainable livelihoods. Our goal is to remain at the forefront of environmental protection– specifically pertaining to ocean health. This means both supporting policy that benefit's our ocean's ecosystems, as well as getting directly involved in community projects and initiatives. Water accounts for about 71 percent of the Earth's surface, and it's our responsibility to protect it for future generations.</p></div>

	<div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><h3>Climate</h3><p>Our ocean plays a crucial role in keeping the planet’s temperature balanced and driving weather. Unfortunately, it's also absorbed most of the planet’s warming—over 90%—and a significant amount of our carbon pollution as a result of human-caused climate change.</p><h3>Litter</h3><p>Every minute, about a dump-truck load of plastic goes into the oceans, sullying beaches, hurting wildlife, and contaminating our food supply.</p><h3>Oil Spills</h3><p>Today, oil and gas exploration is probing the Earth’s most remote and inhospitable places. Oil spills can occur from blowouts, pipeline leaks or failures, or shipping accidents. These spills pose a serious threat to ecosystems.</p></div>
