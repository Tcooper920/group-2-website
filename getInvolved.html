        <p>The threats faced by our ocean planet may seem overwhelming. In the face of pollution, climate change, overfishing, and other daunting problems, what you can do on your own may seem like a drop in the bucket. But if we begin working together now, we can make a huge difference.</p>

            <h4>Take to the shores</h4>

            <p>Marine debris has become a major issue facing the oceans today. It’s estimated that 10 to 20 million tons of plastic trash make their way to the ocean each year through a number of pathways, like litter, runoff, and direct dumping. Despire these grim facts, you can help! Take to the shores with a trash bag and gloves and collect this litter before it makes it's way to the ocean.

            <h4>Vote on ocean issues</h4>
            
                <p>Electing public officials that support good ocean policies can help us protect marine life and our oceans. Do your research on candidates and make an informed decision, then exercise your right (and responsibility) to vote. And don’t let Election Day be the last time they hear from you. Follow up with your candidates and elected officials regularly to remind them of policies you care about.</p>

            <h4>Pledge to quit cutlery</h4>
            <p>In 2018, for the first time since Ocean Conservancy first began counting cutlery as a separate data category, plastic forks, knives and spoons were among the top ten most-collected items in the world during Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup (ICC). ICC volunteers removed nearly 2 million from beaches and waterways around the world.</p>
            <p>A 2015 study by Ocean Conservancy scientists and partners found that plastic cutlery are among the most dangerous to ocean animals such as seabirds and turtles, especially as they break up into smaller microplastics.</p>
            <p>For the sake of our ocean and the animals that call it home…</p>
