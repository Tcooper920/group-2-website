            <h4>Pledge to quit cutlery</h4>
            <p>In 2018, for the first time since Ocean Conservancy first began counting cutlery as a separate data category, plastic forks, knives and spoons were among the top ten most-collected items in the world during Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup (ICC). ICC volunteers removed nearly 2 million from beaches and waterways around the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A 2015 study by Ocean Conservancy scientists and partners found that plastic cutlery are among the most dangerous to ocean animals such as seabirds and turtles, especially as they break up into smaller microplastics.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the sake of our ocean and the animals that call it home…</p>
